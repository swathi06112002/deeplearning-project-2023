# deeplearning-project-2023

This endeavor aims to create a tool for visually impaired individuals, serving as an Image-to-Speech converter. Employing deep learning and natural language processing methods, the system analyzes images, produces detailed descriptions, and transforms these textual captions into audio. The primary objective is to offer a resource facilitating the comprehension of image content for visually impaired individuals, thereby fostering accessibility and independence.

# Key Features:


*Image-to-Caption Generation: The system generates textual descriptions of images using a deep learning model based on the Show, Attend, and Tell paper.

*Caption-to-Speech Synthesis: It transforms the generated captions into spoken language, enabling visually impaired individuals to comprehend the content of images.

*Attention Mechanism: This model uses an attention mechanism to focus on relevant parts of an image during caption generation, improving the accuracy of descriptions.

*Greedy Search:This method tends to generate one sequence that maximizes the likelihood of the next word. The `evaluate` function takes an image as input and returns the generated caption using greedy search.

*Beam Search: An optional method for generating captions that explore multiple word sequences, enhancing the quality of descriptions.

*BLEU Score: The system uses BLEU scores to assess the quality of generated captions and provides visualization tools to understand the attention mechanism's behavior.
